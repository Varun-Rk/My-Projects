       " 'my honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.i have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iphone! i used to roast iphone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, i finally decided to buy a iphone and switch from android to ios and boy was i right!i never even held an iphone in my life before because of its price, but now i made a great choice even if i had to spend all my savings on it.iphone 13 is so smooth that even my iqoo 7 legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iphone has only 60hz. and i can’t believe what i’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.i was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo i had 66w fast charger where as for iphone i had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.display quality is truly flagship level and i’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, build quality is great.i would recommend not to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. because i don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.you can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iphone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. front camera is really good too, truly flagship.speakers are great.battery life is better than my previous devices,ios is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.note : while playing bgmi you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at hd + extreme graphics. which is also good. pro max would be far better in terms of battery.for the software? yes i feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, lock screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.but other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. i was very disappointed at myself when i paid for the iphone but when i received it i was truly happy that i bought it.truly worth it.',\n",

contacting amazon for the replacement , they asked us to connect to apple and when connected to apple , they asked to connect with amazon . blame game begins and we end up paying the price . awfull service . i am going to tag on the social media both amazon and apple . such a big scam just but iphone 12 ! it ’ s not worth the money ! unless ur from bjp or something where you ’ re full with corrupt money , then go ahead . i am poor and i cant afford it lmao xdxdxdxdxd so if you have money to flex buy it i am bored thats why i am writing this review while drinking coffee i have my chemistry exam on manday and cant study mole concept and got bored thats why i came here to write this review if you read this review til here very good you justt wasted your time now go and do something productive :) i do not have money that i can get a phone but i have a dream to get a phone which will definitely be fulfilled one day same as i phone 12 😑 . who so ever is reading this review i suggest go for i phone 12 my honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object . i have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iphone ! i used to roast iphone for its prices , lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc , but my last android phone ( iqoo 7 legend ) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12 , tired of bugs and software glitches in android , i finally decided to buy a iphone and switch from android to ios and boy was i right ! i never even held an iphone in my life before because of its price , but now i made a great choice even if i had to spend all my savings on it.iphone 13 is so smooth that even my iqoo 7 legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iphone has only 60hz . and i can ’ t believe what i ’ m seeing , all the games / apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android . i was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo i had 66w fast charger where as for iphone i had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs , but charging speed isn ’ t disappointing.display quality is truly flagship level and i ’ m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not , being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful , build quality is great . i would recommend not to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro . because i don ’ t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.you can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iphone 13 , wide angle camera struggles in low light , but main camera is really good , captures true colours . front camera is really good too , truly flagship.speakers are great.battery life is better than my previous devices , ios is very optimised in terms of battery life , easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.note : while playing bgmi you loose around 2 % battery every 6minutes at hd + extreme graphics . which is also good . pro max would be far better in terms of battery.for the software ? yes i feel like there are few downsides , even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs , it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc , lock screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying , clearing all notifications is also very annoying.but other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase . i was very disappointed at myself when i paid for the iphone but when i received it i was truly happy that i bought it.truly worth it . the look is retrograde . feel is cheap . does not have physical double sim . the airtel does not offer esim for prepaid connection . fortunately jio revised an esim that got activated in 2hrs ’ . there is nothing so spectacular about the camera . the cinematic mode is good.this is my first exposure to iphone.impression : as good as any high end handset . android is really more user friendly.battery life for a new hand set is just good . sustains 12hrs ’ normal mixed use . assuming you ’ re starting with a good foundation , i think the list of what really makes a big difference in phone upgrades is actually short . the first thing on the list is improved battery life . the second is an improved camera.this two factor really matter in our day to day life and regular useno any other things are improved like a screen and chip performanceoverall soft update for 12 the media could not be loaded . iphone is so good but my phone is four times hang so i am facing some difficulties please solve problems if you ’ re moving from iphone 11 or previous gen then it ’ s the best iphone ever . from 12 to 13 , you won ’ t feel any significant changes . i moved from android to ios and i couldn ’ t be more happier . price is very low than expected . i don\\'t buy cheap phones 😜 . waiting for iphone 20 ... to buy a s a p i switched from oneplus 5t to iphone 13 . the reasons i switched was 1 . battery life of oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and oneplus hardly cared to explain this . i also suspected that oneplus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life . 2 . wanted to get an android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues . 3 . oneplus device also suffered from screenburn.having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iphones lack basic features such as1 . display of date and time on status bar 2 . the rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed . 3 . amazon app does not allow purchase if kindle books on ios devices . 4 . typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a oneplus device.overall , i am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though i must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered . the media could not be loaded . i switched from android to ios.there are so many things you can not do on iphone.if you want a phone which have good looks and phone doesn ’ t do anything else then you can buy iphone.battery life is fine.charging speed is also fine.camera quality is also fine but some of android phones with this range have better camera quality than this one . phone , email & sms management extremely unfriendly , primitive and restrictiveunnecessary animation on each actionvery bad user experience this is my first iphonephone looks and feels premium in hand , definitely you cannot compare with chinese android phones.battery is sufficient for normal day to day use , if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours , i don ’ t play games so can ’ t comment.security , os and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that , this is where iphone stands out from other phones.volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from chinese smart phones . same dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.didn ’ t explore much on apple eco system , how ever i understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.nothing comes for free here , in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user ( less customisation and no side loaders ) in a good way , if you respect your privacy , security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iphone.new users are good to go for iphone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers , you will get extra features that are missing in 12.12 users forget about upgrading to 13 it will be a joke for you , it won ’ t worth it . this is just a brick . cannot be used for calling or internet access unless you have wifi . this device has serious network issues . my one plus 9 pro and realme 7 shows 100 % network bars and internet work fast enought to stream multiple hd videos at the same time ( speed test result 45mbps - airtel postpaid ) . but this apple device shows only 1 bar and sometimes none . you can\\'t do anything other than just looking at phone . i kept 9 pro and iphone 13 at the same place at the same time having airtel postpaid sim card inserted . oneplus gets full coverage of same network while iphone gets only 1 bar coverage which cannot be used for anything . when i checked online , found that a lot of people facing same network issue with iphone 13 series . seriously , i would not recommend anyone to buy this brick . apple making fools of images ridden duffers . overpriced phone , don\\'t have bsic features like 120 hz display , only 3100 mah battery . reviewing after 2 months usage . + ve : 1 . battery 2 . display 3 . camera-ve : 1 . screen not responding in all the corners , i need to click three or four times 2 . portrait mode pictures , one plus does better than this 3 . phone got stuck three times 4 . when i play pubg / bgmi fire button takes some time to respond ( not sure it ’ s bgmi issue ) and also with mobile data bgmi not able to handle extreme graphicsnote : these are all my experiences as new iphone user who used oneplus 7 earlier . please don\\'t buy iphone from amazon as i have received the box with broken seal . you can only replace and there is no option to refund . so guys beware . though we talk a lot about high price for iphones , this is worth the amount . smooth touch , perfect to hold in hand . for the screen size of 6.1 \" , it looks small overall . i could have gone for pro max but more than 1.5 l budget is way too much for me :-) * good battery back-up ( with low battery mode always on , 5 hours of talk-time , around 2 hours of twitter and 2 hours of whatsapp usage , 1 hour of songs listening , 1 hour of rummy / candy crush games and notification of all these items , the battery comes for more than 24 hours for me ) * getting charged quickly from 20 % to 100 % within 2 hours * perfect camera and i love that \\' live \\' photo option * body design is awesome . when i held it in my hand for the first time , felt really happy about the design and the size of the iphone 13 . scores high on style , looks , great camera , fast . iphone set-up from previous versions of iphone is very very fast and smooth . entire set-up took just 10-15 mins and everything was copied over w / o any loss of data . face id set-up is very powerful . battery life could be still better . obviously price point could be a little more affordable . wait for the price to drop below 60k is the best value for this phone the media could not be loaded . highly recommended to buy this phone as i have switched from android to ios but still i am feeling very comfortable to use this phone as it is user friendly . amazon sells original product and keeps you updated about the delivery unlike other marketplaces and also provides great discounts which is amazing , so for the one\\'s planning to buy can go ahead and choose amazon to buy an iphone . the iphone 13 is the best iphone ever . fantastic phone . the best camera . fastest processor . and offcourse a status symbol . go for it . it\\'s the best smart phone . i was so afraid to buy this costly phone from online but thanks to amazon , i got it with good offers , got this genuine , india made iphone & also verified by apple website . i am very happy by upgrading from iphone 7 to iphone 13 . using dual sim another extra new experience from iphone , but always on outgoing call e-sim network not available . but i am satisfied with this purchase . as apple says \" there is no phone like iphone \" . i was not sure whether to buy from amazon or not as i was more willing to buy it directly from apple online store . but because of 11k discount , i ordered it from amazon and the product received is good and i have verified the warranty on apple website using serial number . headset of my iphone is not workingwhat can i do iphone 13 awesome phone , screen ultra clear , sound very clear too good , amazon delivery was awesome as always , iphone rocks.phone is having 60hz but it doesn ’ t look like that , easily compare to 90hz phone kudos to apple regarding the phone . amazon delivered it the same day , verified and it was a genuine product , been using it for 4 days now . the battery life was my main concern and in this phone it ’ s s impressive , we can easily get through the day with some percent left . a full charge takes around 1 and half hour . performance and camera is reliable and consistent . had to learn gesture ’ s as i have migrated from android oreo to ios 15 . thus , i am happy with the purchase . front camera wasn ’ t working . got a defective piece . initially i was worried about this costly phone to order online but then i look up the reviews and then i just ordered this phone.today morning i received my phone . and then i was happy to get this genuine phone delivered by the seller . i am totally happy with the purchase and i can now recommend this phone to anyone who wants to buy this online by applying the offers you are get . i liket apple phones i use in 12 but don\\'t different small changes byclone 15.and touch and tha mobile is more than small in 12 everyone is a gangster until a real gangster comes into the room.loved the product . go for it guys the media could not be loaded . i m a one + user ... 5t and 7pro .. now first time iphone family ... it\\'s camera is superb ... 👌 👌 👌 battery toh la jvab . ik hi dil hai tim bhai kitni baar jito gye . i ’ m happy with iphone 13 . it ’ s little bit heavy like iphone 11 but it ’ s fine . it ’ s a great phone . after my 6s plus , it ’ s an amazing upgrade but i wish i would have bought the pro version instead . i miss the features that phone has . this is my first iphone and i must say it ’ s a beast ! ! ! battery life on normal usage goes for like one and a half days ! ui is smooth and hassle free in one word fantastic … . beast of a performer .. it good right balance of size and performancebattery life is major usp of this mobile … two major cons : - 120 htz refresh rate is must have for this price pointcharging speed is bit slow but that could be managed by great battery life the media could not be loaded . good experience fantastic red .. just unboxed it so cannot say about anything else . loved it . thank you amazon go on without any hesitation 👍 i thought upgrading from 11 to 13 would be a hassle . i could transfer all my data from 11 to 13 very easily , never even had to connect to a pc or download an app . the media could not be loaded . this looks professional colour and perfect 👍 . nice product . you don ’ t need to write anything when it comes to iphone because iphone just rules the world . simply amazing … price is too much though . the only disappointing thing is that they have stopped giving proper charger and also there is no earphones .. initially , i thought of compromising with camera features and decided to buy iphone 13 . but now , i regret . iphone camera definitely needs improvement , otherwise iphone is best . you may also feel little heavy when compared to other leading flagship mobiles . the media could not be loaded . there is a light source flares on camera image when you direct your phone camera on light source . this is creating green light spot on image . it is problem with the iphone lens . i don ’ t recommend this phone if you are a fan of camera . but you can use snapseed app to remove it . phone looks good basically the diagonal camera . camera quality awesome . i was using i phone 6 then baught this i phone 13 . the media could not be loaded . the media could not be loaded . good performance value for money not exactly best product excellent phone , far better than previous versions the battery has been draining significantly . customer service were not that helpful and i\\'m losing my mind to resolve this . i\\'m so disappointed in myself for buying this phone . what a terrible experience performance are really brilliant 🤩 , and have to say about the battery life … excellence too good , screen display doesn ’ t feel like you are working with 60hz display , it feels like 90 hz , phone os is so smooth , camera is excellent battery backup is good . over all excellent phone nice product . fastest delivery by amazon and thanks to seller for genuine product . really really awesome model to be in hands .. the display has a great variation comparable to the android mobiles . just go for it no need any explorer . best of classrecommend to wait for any offergot it for 73990 gave scratched phone as and screen broken and also denied for return too good camera and battery life all is well but siri doesn ’ t work maximum time . its too much boring to turn on and off siri to make it listen . apple always the best n perfect good one but photos taken in this camera changing the originality . call recording feature for indians is needed for free of cost the media could not be loaded . this is a great mobile knock knock apple ka to naam hi kaafi hai the great photo and video quality specially for slow motion video good display quite handy n nice in look best in offering battery drains fast and it should not be priced more than rs 60000 finally , i gift this mobile to my lovely wife.but it\\'s very difficult to live with one kidney ! ! ! experiencing 1st iphone usage .. battery life is bit down otherwise worth every penny .. value for money

starlight or pink , no finger prints at all good productcamera is superbsmoothness is of next levelfeeling proud and feel honor as expected i think i got duplicate mobile first phone amazing liking the device from all the aspects ( battery life , performance , software ) battery charging very slow not a good option to buy iphone 13 face unlock below standard go for it . the media could not be loaded . the phone is heating badly when put on charge . and when on use of 15mins , the phone is getting heated up the battery life and camera of this phone is very good . good phone . got delivered

amazon thanku loved to buy it defective piece , can ’ t contact the seller too phone was nice and delivery was late i received used mobile best in this range got delivered in 1.5 days . amazing amazon ! ! good phone overall good buy supar starlight amazing awesome . ty amazon mostly liked it ’ s worthy ! like nice nice performance worth every penny . purely loved it 💙 value for money ok no big upgrades at all ! ! it ’ s the same as iphone 12 except that they changed the camera designed ! apple stop fooling us you can buy two to three samsung / other best mobiles with this specifications .. not up to the mark . only camera got changed compared to iphone 12 so i ordered this phone from apple ’ s official website . and have been using this for the past 1 week and trust me it has one of the best batteries you will find on any phone . i am a moderate user when it comes to cellphones i . e the basic instagram facebook whatsapp youtube and netflix . this phone if charged fully lasts up to 24 hours if used moderately without any heavy gaming.the reason i am writing this review is because of the useless comments of people that are rated high but can ’ t actually afford this phone.coming from one plus 6t this phone is a huge jump ( i love my one plus … still using it as my work phone ) but it is obviously a lot to adjust to since we are completely switching to a different os seems like shifting to a different nation all together.anyway .. if you do have a good enough budget you should definitely go for this beauty very expensive and not working well as i was thinking about it so i think this is my wrong selection . wastage of money . better go for iphone 12 pro . amazon great indian sale also ll be there at 4th oct just grab ip12pro with huge discount . and iphone 13 assembled in china but 12pro assamble in india i don ’ t know why they are doing this kind of things i mean at 70k even you don ’ t get the 120hz display , at least 90hz must be there . only camera improvement , instead selling phones why they don ’ t sell apple dslrs . this product is not worth for its moneyif u r switching 1st time from android , then you will feel scrolling is very slow in it , refresh rate just 60hz , even screen is just 6.1 with big notch , making it look small , if you really have good amount of money , then buy only pro max series with 6.7 inch screen , expect camera , everything is better in android was using 11 before this . wanted to go for 13 pro . wished 120 hertz pro motion display in my phone . but that costed way too much . nevertheless this standard 13 model is not too behind . almost same cameras . amazing battery life and speakers . and build is similar to 12 offourse but functionality is better . great changes from 12 especially in camera and battery . perfect value smartphone in 72000 ₹ ( 128gb ) . ios is ios . ecosystem is unmatched . hence for me a perfect phone . the biggest improvement i have noted is the battery life . it ’ s really good . upgraded from my 7 plus after 4.6 years . another thing i like is magsafe charging . one of the main issue i face with my old phone was charging port failure due to dust accumulation . magsafe charge helps from above said issue . of course we have to pay for that extra . even though am enjoying bigger battery , the thickness increased a bit and it is bit annoying . my advice is it ’ s a highly paid model , so use it minimum 3 years . the back camera was not working . flash light was also not working . most importantly amazon denies the replacement or refund . i went to the apple service centre they kept the phone and worked like snail . still they are diagnosing the issue . actually i am android user since 10 years & now i switched to iphone yes its little difficult to adjust and comfortable with iphone it\\'s take almost 1 week to friendly with themotherwise i am student so as a student usage the battery gives me almost 1.5 days with once full charge & no doubt performance is next levelcamera is good both rear & front but you will miss telephoto lense but overall is goodi got huge discount it\\'s almost i spend 63,000 / - inr for 128 gbtrust me if you have sufficient fund go for itotherwise next option is iphone 12 for 50,000 / - i think in this price is goodthanks you have to pay 95000 + for this stupid phone which doesn ’ t make any sense especially when they don ’ t even pack a charger and 120hz display in such an expensive phone . buy google pixel phone instead . could\\'ve been better , this is just such a small update .. i\\'d say stick to your old iphone 12 if you have it .. if not then maybe think of buying this apple iphone quality is good . battery life is good initially , hope it remains same for some time . money wise all apple products are costly . i saw in nearby storesit looks almost like iphone 12 except camera positionboth the phones are awesomewhoever is having money can go for itbut people like me can see in stores this thing is absolute beast in battery when compared to other iphone\\'s . i used note 20 ultra before and i am getting nearly the same battery life with this phone in this perfect shape . i am super happy about my purchase . the camera is really great with some new features . if u are looking for a new apple device and your budget is 80k + u can definitely buy this and not regret . 💯 before this i have samsung and i never click self image standing in front of the mirror tab \" mausi \" ne kaha apple lelo aur ab shakal kesi bhi aaye selfie mirror k aage.note : 1 saal ruppee showoff k liye hi dete h mostly apple lene wale log just received this in the morning . my mother loves the red colour . also , the camera ’ s pretty impressive . haven ’ t tested the battery yet . but , i ’ m sure it ’ s much better than the previous versions.the best part is that red colour ’ s not flashy . everything almost similar to iphone 12 , either go iphone 12 only or samsung if android is not an issue . overrated product . nothing new . camera has improved many folds.battery improvement is like wooooowwww ! ! ! it ’ s a go go if you own iphone 11 or older . the media could not be loaded . go and buy this phoneit has apple bionic 15 chipset which is very powerful.you can play hardcore games like pro players no biometrics with many ui flaws . too expensive at 90k range.better wait for new versions so that the price will drop for this version substantially . love the phone ... its amazing the camera quality is so good ... apple never disappoints .. though people with iphone 12 wouldn\\'t find anything new maja nai aaya sach bolu pichhla wala hi haikuch naya waya karte nai hai yeh apple waale bilkul maja nai aaya best phone ever . i was using iphone 12 but now i had upgrade to 13 thanks amazon thank a lot it\\'s good phone more stora it\\'s camera and well only nice phone iphone 13 it\\'s better and all good apple i phone 13 having lot of good features but difficulties for sr people .. missing home button , no call recording , need to buy c type charger etc .. nan battery camera smooth touch awesome white colour best colour i am very impressed with the quality of the product .. truely amazed with its performance , though i miss my second kidney ... still happy and surviving ... go for it today ... best batteryyy life everr 👍 🏻 👍 🏻 👍 🏻 👍 🏻 go for it .. i m in love with iphone 13osm phone with osm battery life ✌ ️ the media could not be loaded . beast performance 🔥 battery life is better but problem with this is unable to scan codes apart from that 13 is unbeatable best i phonei ’ ll upgrade from 11proto 13 probeast phonebest in camerano words for.applek nan gud product and performance both are perfectly work service is also gud pictures thanks apple for gud gadgets thanks thanks i didn\\'t use the product but this is very hard security device and it\\'s my dream .. and you also purchase the iphone 13 this product is duplicate of iphone 12 only camera design changed . very low quality of this product buy samsung mobile phone i can\\'t afford it\\'s cover 😂 😂 😂 and you are giving discount on that phone 😂 i can only use its launcher 😂 😂 good but buy i phone 12 for this price that is much good in my opinion and 11 pro i nan nan iphone 13 ( blue ) , outlook looks good but not attractive , looks dim . after usage of 20min , i can see fingerprints all over the phone . cinematic video features looks great , can\\'t use iphone 13 charging cable with other iphone adapters . finally my first iphone experience is average . ignore the negative comments made by amateurs.reasons for upgrade : 1 . camera : bigger camera aperture , ois , cinematic mode . low light pictures are outstanding as you can see the 2nd picture of the flower taken at night . also some of the pictures during daylight for reference . 2 . battery : apple has really done a good job in battery management . it\\'s giving a good battery back up . 3 . processor : new a15 processor and better performance . 4 . software : this is the usual strong point of any iphone with ios . 5 . storage : not to forget you ’ re now getting 128 gigs as base storage compared to 64 gigs last year on base model price.who should buy this phone : 1 . if you\\'re already using an iphone 12 don\\'t bother to upgrade . wait for next year release . 2 . those who are using iphone 10 or previous versions can surely feel much of a difference . 3 . price gap : iphone 12 is 70,000 inr with no offers at present . iphone 13 with 6000 discount on hdfc cards makes the actual price around 74000 . it makes no sense to save 4000 and buy an year old device iphone 12 if you ’ re upgrading from iphone 10 or previous versions . 4 . iphone 12 purchase will only make sense compared to iphone 13 if it\\'s price gets reduced to 55000.customer expectations : 1 . at least an always on display . 2 . on display fingerprint scanner . 3 . a 90hz refresh rate if not 120hz for iphone 13 model . in india we are paying a lot for base models . oneplus 7 to iphone 13the ui and feel which iphone gives is mind blowing . i ’ ve been using iphone 6s for almost last 6 years . the only problem i ever faced in its entire lifespan was the battery life . and apple has finally broken that . apart from amazing user experience , camera , and all that is great about iphone , the battery life of iphone 13 is simply awesome . do not doubt for a second if you want to upgrade your phone . jus go for it . may not be the best one to upgrade to , but i absolutely loved this phone as a first time iphone user . battery and camera are better than expected . this is first time iam using an apple smartphone and iam completely satisfied with this product in major areas with compare to other android devices and this is the next level experience of using iphone 13 service device improved camera.very impressive battery.the screen is much brighter . pretty pink color with amazing features apple has added to the new phone ! feels very light while holding the phone ! happy customer ❤ ️ pro : brighter display , great cameras , and a15 bionic chipcons : lacks fast charging . battery life is a pleasant surprise , and with a 20w chargers it ’ s a good experience . with the camera enhancements , it ’ s feels like a good value for money must buy . value for money loved it ! battery life is awesome . since i had issues with my previous iphone battery i am quite satisfied with this one . best iphone i have had in a while i get iphone 13 thanks amazon the midnight colour is little bit like navy blue and besides all the things are good and also i like the new cinematic mode of it.it ’ s good great to use ! has an amazing camera . quite light and looks stylish . my first iphone good good product battery life great full day backup nice one nan nan ❤ ️ this phone has amazing features idk why people hate it this deserves to be liked more as the phone even has cinematic mode perfect for people who make movies the smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years . over the years , it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months . amid these challenging times apple , like a bunch of other companies , has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iphones . in this series , the company , as is customary , announced the iphone 13 as its successor to last year ’ s iphone 12.the newly launched iphone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iphone 12 , which includes a smarter camera , a brighter display , a bigger battery and of course , a more advanced processor to name a few . then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage . sure , it ’ s a tad bit heavier than the iphone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iphone models , like the iphone 11 or the iphone xr that i have been using , for what seems like aeons now , you will be grateful for everything that the iphone 13 offers . i switched from oneplus 5t to iphone 13 . the reasons i switched was 1 . battery life of oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and oneplus hardly cared to explain this . i also suspected that oneplus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life . 2 . wanted to get an android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues . 3 . oneplus device also suffered from screenburn.having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iphones lack basic features such as1 . display of date and time on status bar 2 . the rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed . 3 . amazon app does not allow purchase if kindle books on ios devices . 4 . typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a oneplus device.overall , i am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though i must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered . i always wanted to buy an iphone this one is just made for me it\\'s has a very good camera and i just love the look.if you are going for iphone than i highly recommend this phone to you other than other than 12 or 11 . i switched from oneplus 6t to iphone 13 . just a fabulous mobile . amazing camera just like a dslr in pocket . i purchased my iphone 13 from iprime store because of same price online & offline . bought it at ₹ 81,800 . 00 ( iphone + 20w adapter ) . i have no money to buy this ph , i am poor guy , kind hearted person can gift a i phone any model no problem . may god bless you 🙏 🙏 🙏 not buy due to money problems.aspo jui fds bgf and tell i am senior citizen 65 years old will be there this is the best iphone till date . same price . superb battery and awesome camera . if you\\'re using a iphone 12 dont go for this . if iphone 10 / 11 blindly purchase it iphone 13 256 gb variant purchased from reliance digital really value for money phone especially battery back up is mind blowing overall good phone . its a great deal for me to purchase this one , its a great camara well focused , best ever battery backup ... i recently got my iphone 13 128 gb got amazed with the camera and other things … … worth for ur money loved this product nan best camera phone and battery too good today i got my iphone 13 starlight and guess what it was just extra mind-blowing than my imagination .. just loved the way of packaging and delivery .. one more thing is that we are confused sometimes because of the negative comments like fake phone , broken , clone phone received ... believe me just ignore those stupid negative comment section , & just go for it without any hesitation . because nothing fraud is going to happen with you . it\\'s very secure , trusty . go for it my dream is to buy this phone but pocket is so tight . just a marichika to me.every day i think to have this . good phone as this iphone offers well stable ios and one of the best hardwares this is a nice phone to buy its better to buy samsung or nokia'"

       " 'i used to roast iphone for its prices , lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc , but my last android phone ( iqoo 7 legend ) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12 , tired of bugs and software glitches in android , i finally decided to buy a iphone and switch from android to ios and boy was i right !',\n",
       " 'i never even held an iphone in my life before because of its price , but now i made a great choice even if i had to spend all my savings on it.iphone 13 is so smooth that even my iqoo 7 legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iphone has only 60hz .',\n",

       " 'i was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iphone because in iqoo i had 66w fast charger where as for iphone i had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs , but charging speed isn ’ t disappointing.display quality is truly flagship level and i ’ m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not , being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful , build quality is great .',\n",
